Description: catalyticmodels is an R package for estimating the age-specific force of infection (FOI) and the basic reproduction number (R0) from cross-sectional seroprevalence data. This package has been designed to accommodate both specific age data as well as age-grouped data. The package implements widely used FOI formulations: constant, linear, exponentially damped linear, piecewise-constant, and a cubic B-spline-based option. It also supports common practicalities such as imperfect assay sensitivity, maternal antibodies, and waning immunity, and it reports uncertainty via bootstrapping.
