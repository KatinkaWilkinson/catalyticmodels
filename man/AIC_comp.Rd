\title{Compare Models by AIC}
\usage{
AIC_comp(cat_models)
}
\arguments{
\item{cat_models}{A \strong{named list} of catalytic model objects (e.g.,
the elements returned by \code{FoiFromCatalyticModel()} and collected
into a list). Each model must contain at least:
\itemize{
\item \code{t}, \code{y}, \code{n} (the data used to fit the model),
\item \code{params_MLE} (named vector of MLEs),
\item \code{pi_t}, \code{group_pi}, \code{group_foi} (model functions),
\item \code{rho} and \code{param_names} (as used by the likelihood).
}
Spline-based fits are not supported (i.e., models with \code{spline_pi_t}
produce an error).}
}
\value{
If a \strong{single} model is supplied, returns a list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{ranking_string}: a formatted line with the model's AIC, and
\item \code{AIC_vals}: a named list containing \code{AIC}, \code{k}, and \code{n}.
}

If \strong{multiple} models are supplied, a ranked table is printed to the console
and the function returns:
\itemize{
\item \code{AIC_vals}: a named list (one element per model), each containing
\code{AIC}, \code{k}, and \code{n}.
}
}
\description{
Computes the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for one or more fitted
catalytic models and prints a ranked summary (smaller AIC is better).
}
\details{
For each model, the function evaluates the negative binomial log-likelihood
via \code{neg_total_binom_loglik()} and computes
\deqn{\mathrm{AIC} = 2\,(-\log L) + 2k,}
where \(k\) is the number of estimated parameters. Results are printed as a
ranked list and also returned in a structured object.

\strong{Important:} AIC values are only comparable across models fitted to the
same data \([t, y, n]\). Ensure you pass models trained on identical
datasets.

# Suppose m1 and m2 are fitted catalytic models from FoiFromCatalyticModel()
mods <- list(Constant = m1, Farringtons = m2)
AIC_comp(mods)  # prints ranking; returns per-model AIC, k, n
