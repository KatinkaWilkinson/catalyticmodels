\title{Compare Models by AICc}
\usage{
AICc_comp(cat_models)
}
\arguments{
\item{cat_models}{A \strong{named list} of catalytic model objects (for example,
elements returned by \code{FoiFromCatalyticModel()} and collected into a
list, or the list produced by \code{FoiFromCatalyticModels()}). Each model
must contain at least:
\itemize{
\item \code{t}, \code{y}, \code{n} (the data used to fit the model),
\item \code{params_MLE} (named vector of MLEs),
\item \code{pi_t}, \code{group_pi}, \code{group_foi} (model functions),
\item \code{rho} and \code{param_names} (as used by the likelihood).
}
Spline-based fits are not supported (models with \code{spline_pi_t} produce
an error).}
}
\value{
If a \strong{single} model is supplied, returns a list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{ranking_string}: a formatted line with the model's AICc (or \code{NA}),
\item \code{AICc_vals}: a named list containing \code{AICc}, \code{k}, and \code{n}.
}

If \strong{multiple} models are supplied, a ranked table is printed to the console
(undefined-AICc models are listed separately) and the function returns:
\itemize{
\item \code{AICc_vals}: a named list (one element per model), each containing
\code{AICc}, \code{k}, and \code{n}.
}
}
\description{
Computes the small-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) for
one or more fitted catalytic models and prints a ranked summary
(smaller AICc is better). Models with undefined AICc are listed but not ranked.
}
\details{
For each model, the function evaluates the negative binomial log-likelihood
via \code{neg_total_binom_loglik()} and computes
\deqn{\mathrm{AIC} = 2\,(-\log L) + 2k,\quad
      \mathrm{AICc} = \mathrm{AIC} + \frac{2k(k+1)}{n - k - 1},}
where \(k\) is the number of estimated parameters and \(n\) is the number of
age groups. If \(n - k - 1 \le 0\), AICc is undefined and reported as \code{NA};
such models are listed in an “undefined AICc” note and excluded from the
ranking.

\strong{Important:} AICc values are only comparable across models fitted to the
same data \([t, y, n]\). Ensure the supplied models were trained on
identical datasets.

# Suppose m1 and m2 are fitted catalytic models from FoiFromCatalyticModel()
mods <- list(Constant = m1, Farringtons = m2)
AICc_comp(mods)  # prints ranking; returns per-model AICc, k, n
