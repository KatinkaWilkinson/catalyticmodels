\title{Farringtonâ€™s Catalytic Model for Seroprevalence}
\usage{
Farringtons(t, y, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A numeric vector of exact ages or midpoints of age intervals.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of seropositive counts for each age or age group.}

\item{n}{A numeric vector of total sample sizes for each age or age group.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{\code{par}}{Maximum likelihood estimates of \code{gamma0}, \code{gamma1}, and \code{gamma2}.}
\item{\code{CIs}}{Bootstrap-based 95\% confidence intervals for each parameter.}
\item{\code{boot_params}}{Bootstrap samples for each parameter.}
}
}
\description{
Fits a flexible catalytic model in which the force of infection (FOI) is governed by three parameters: \eqn{\gamma_0}, \eqn{\gamma_1}, and \eqn{\gamma_2}.
This model allows the FOI to vary non-linearly with age and includes saturation behavior.
}
\details{
The force of infection function is:
\deqn{\lambda(t) = (\gamma_0 t + \gamma_1) \exp(-\gamma_2 t) + \gamma_1}

The cumulative probability of infection by age \eqn{t} is:
\deqn{\pi(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\int_0^t \lambda(s) ds\right)}

This model is suitable when the FOI is expected to increase initially and then decline, reflecting waning exposure or susceptibility with age.

The model estimates the seroprevalence curve by integrating a non-linear FOI function over age. Confidence intervals are computed via nonparametric bootstrap resampling using the \code{create_boot_samps()} function.

If the input \code{t} is based on age intervals, ensure midpoints are used or modify the function to integrate over intervals.
