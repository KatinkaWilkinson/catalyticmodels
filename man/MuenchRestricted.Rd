\title{Muench's Catalytic Model with Constant Force of Infection (Restricted)}
\usage{
MuenchRestricted(t, y, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A numeric vector of exact ages, or a matrix with two columns giving the lower and upper bounds of age intervals.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of seropositive counts for each age group or interval.}

\item{n}{A numeric vector of total sample sizes for each age group or interval.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{par}: Maximum likelihood estimate for the force of infection \code{foi}.
\item \code{CIs}: Bootstrap-based 95\% confidence interval for \code{foi}.
\item \code{boot_params}: Bootstrap samples for \code{foi}.
}
}
\description{
Fits the classical Muench catalytic model under the assumption of a constant force of infection (FOI),
where \eqn{\pi(t) = 1 - \exp(-\lambda t)}. This form assumes full susceptibility from birth,
and that infection risk accumulates exponentially with age.
}
\details{
For age intervals \eqn{[a, b]}, the model computes the average of \eqn{\pi(t)} over the interval:
\deqn{\bar{\pi}_{[a,b]} = \frac{1}{b - a} \int_a^b \left(1 - e^{-\lambda t}\right) dt = 1 - \frac{e^{-\lambda a} - e^{-\lambda b}}{\lambda(b - a)}}

This restricted form of the catalytic model fixes the scaling constants \eqn{k = 1} and \eqn{l = 1},
implying that all individuals are equally susceptible and that infection eventually reaches saturation.
It is suitable for pathogens with long-term endemic circulation and no maternal immunity window.
