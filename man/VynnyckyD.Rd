\title{Vynnycky Catalytic Model D (Constant FOI, Perfect Assay Sensitivity)}
\usage{
VynnyckyD(t, y, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A numeric vector of exact ages, or a matrix with two columns giving the lower and upper bounds of age intervals.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of seropositive counts for each age group or interval.}

\item{n}{A numeric vector of total sample sizes for each age group or interval.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{par}{Maximum likelihood estimate for \code{foi} (force of infection).}
\item{CIs}{Bootstrap-based 95\% confidence interval for \code{foi}.}
\item{boot_params}{Bootstrap samples for \code{foi}.}
}
}
\description{
Implements a catalytic model that assumes a constant force of infection (FOI) across all ages and
perfect assay sensitivity (i.e., all past infections are detected, with \eqn{œÅ = 1}).
}
\details{
The seroprevalence function is:
\deqn{
\pi(t) = 1 - \exp(-\lambda (t - 0.5))
}

For age intervals \eqn{[a, b]}, the model integrates \eqn{\pi(t)} across the interval and returns the average value.

This model is a simplified version of the Muench catalytic model, suitable when assay sensitivity is known to be perfect.
It is appropriate in settings where all infections are detectable and transmission is age-independent.
